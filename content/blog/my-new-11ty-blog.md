Well, hey, I have started a new blog. I'm testing out the Eleventy site generator, and am deploying via Netlify. I'm using Visual Studio Code as my editor and GitHub conduit. The last time I did a blog this way was in 2020, when I was experimenting with the Jamstack — I used Hugo as my static site generator then. My old test site is still available on Netlify: [Generate Static](https://generatestatic.netlify.app/).

I must admit, I'll have to get used to using Markdown again. 

## Fediverse

I was motivated to do this because I'm a big fan of the fediverse and I want to find a way to connect blogging to it. Also I want a fun blog again, somewhere to [create a sidebar](https://mastodon.social/@ricmac/111489177217562043) and put cool things in there — like we used to do in the early 2000s.

For this reason the domain I'm using is fedi.ricmac.org; so it's connected to my personal website at [ricmac.org](https://ricmac.org/).

That's all for now, wish me luck and see you on the interwebs!
